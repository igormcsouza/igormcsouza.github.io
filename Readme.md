# My Web Portifolio

[![bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/bootstrap-5-blueviolet)](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)

Since I started to work with software development I dream to build my own
website to share the things I'm working on as well as to post some of the
studies I do throughout the projects I develop. Well, after many years of HTML
studies I finally put foward the website, using nothing but pure HTML5, CSS3,
Bootstrap5 and plain Javascript.

The main goal is to set a landing page for Myself Corporation and a blog place
so I can show up the discoveries I make. Well, but the sky is the limit for
what I can do here.
